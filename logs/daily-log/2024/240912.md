## 짤막 역사

- commonJS
  - JS가 브라우저 외부에서 어떻게 동작해야 하는지
    - **서버 사이드 자바스크립트의 부상:** Node.js의 등장과 함께 자바스크립트는 서버 사이드 개발에서도 널리 사용되기 시작
    - 처음에는 이름이 serverJS였음
- Different module specifications, such asCommonJS, are universally compatible
  - Not quite. Modules were added to the ECMAScript ES6 specification and allow for code to be reused and more easily replaced. Different specifications - such as CommonJS - are not universally compatible.
- HTML, DOM
  - nested object to structure the web page, for each different pages
  - browser check domain -> download HTML & save in memory
- JavaScript's initial purpose was to **provide interactivity in the browser**
  - "set of controls" that would allow web developers to control the behavior of the webpages
  - Initially, in the late 1990s, there was plain JavaScript that had to be tweaked to suit individual browsers.
  - Then, by the mid-2000s, the jQuery library came out, with the idea of writing less code, but doing more with it. It "leveled the playing field" as it allowed developers to use a single code-base for various browsers.
- JSON, 2001
  - Around 2001, Douglas Crockford came up with a data interchange format based on JavaScript objects. The name given to this format was JSON, which is JavaScript Object Notation.
    - two major reasons for the JSON format becoming the dominant data interchange format that it is today is two-fold:
      - 1, it's very lightweight, with syntax very similar to "a stringified JavaScript object". You'll learn more about the specifics of this later.
      - 2, it's easier to handle in JavaScript code, since, JSON, after all, is *just JavaScript.*
  - superset
    - it adheres to syntax rules of the JavaScript language: all JSON code is JavaScript, but not all JavaScript code is JSON.
- XML
  - Before JSON, the most common data interchange file format was XML (Extensible Markup Language). However, due to XML's syntax, it required more characters to describe the data that was sent. Also, since it was a specific stand-alone language, it wasn't as easily inter-operable with JavaScript.
- V8
  - Then in 2009, a developer named Ryan Dao, decided to use Google's JavaScript V8 engine and make it work on the server
  - This is how Node.js was born and how JavaScript became a language for both front-end and back-end.
- NodeJS
  ```
  - **Server-side development:** Building web applications and APIs.
  - **Command-line tools:** Creating scripts to automate tasks. // node app.js
  - **Desktop applications:** Developing cross-platform applications using frameworks like Electron.
  ```
