### SSH, Secure Shell

The advantage of using SSH is that you don't need to enter in your credentials -> each time you access to... somewhere like github remote repository.

This requires the creation of keys: a public and a private key. The keys are generated and stored on your local machine, then the public key is copied to the Github server.

```
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your@email.com"
```

```
Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in ./ssh/private_key.
Your public key has been saved in ./ssh/public_key.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:UDQI5N1FL3QSq7Gj1o12mkr9Me7qGMZAeE1s9BWIln4 your@email.com
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ED25519 256]--+
|   .o+o=+oOo.    |
|   o +B+.= =     |
|  . +++ + o .    |
|   o  ..E+ .     |
|    .  .S        |
|     o + +       |
|      B = =      |
|     + + * o     |
|      oo=o+      |
+----[SHA256]-----+
```

- Both keys => /.ssh
- public key `.pub` => `cat ~/.ssh/<YOUR KEY>.pub | clip ` => github

### git diff cli

```
git diff

diff --cc Feature.js
index 1b1136f,c3be92f..0000000
