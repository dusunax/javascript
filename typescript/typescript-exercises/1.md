Intro:

    We are starting a small community of users. For performance
    reasons, we have decided to store all users right in the code.
    This way we can provide our developers with more
    user-interaction opportunities. With user-related data, at least.
    All the GDPR-related issues will be solved some other day.
    This would be the basis for our future experiments during
    these exercises.

Exercise:

    Given the data, define the interface "User" and use it accordingly.

 */
export type User = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  occupation: string;
};

export const users: User[] = [
  {
    name: "Max Mustermann",
    age: 25,
    occupation: "Chimney sweep",
  },
  {
    name: "Kate Müller",
    age: 23,
    occupation: "Astronaut",
  },
];

export function logPerson(user: User) {
  console.log(` - ${user.name}, ${user.age}`);
}

console.log("Users:");
users.forEach(logPerson);
```

### object type 선언에 interface를 사용할 수 있음

- 왜?
  > Interfaces: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#interfaces
- Type과 Interface를 자유롭게 선택 가능
  - interface가 extendable
- TS는 structure(구조)와 capabilities(기능)에만 관심 있음
  - structurally typed type system 구조적 타이핑

### Type aliases & Interface

- Type aliases and interfaces are very similar, and in many cases you can choose between them freely. Almost all features of an interface are available in type, the key distinction is that a type cannot be re-opened to add new properties vs an interface which is always extendable.
- For the most part, you can choose based on personal preference, and TypeScript will tell you if it needs something to be the other kind of declaration. If you would like a heuristic, use interface until you need to use features from type.
