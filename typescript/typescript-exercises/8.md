# typescript exercises

## Answer

```tsx
/*

Intro:

    Project grew and we ended up in a situation with
    some users starting to have more influence.
    Therefore, we decided to create a new person type
    called PowerUser which is supposed to combine
    everything User and Admin have.

Exercise:

    Define type PowerUser which should have all fields
    from both User and Admin (except for type),
    and also have type 'powerUser' without duplicating
    all the fields in the code.

*/

interface PowerUser extends Omit<User, "type">, Omit<Admin, "type"> {
  type: "powerUser";
}
```
